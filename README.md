# Adidas-sales-Analysis
From this Adidas sales analysis, I understand that the main goal is to use Power BI to help decision-makers get clear insights from the data and improve business strategies. The business requirements are focused on understanding sales performance better, identifying which regions are doing well or poorly, checking how products are performing, and making informed pricing and margin decisions. Basically, it’s about using data to make smarter choices that increase sales and profit.

The KPIs give us the main things to track: total sales, profitability, sales volume, pricing, and margins. These help Adidas see not just how much they are selling, but also how much profit they are making and whether their pricing strategy is working.

From the dashboard, I can see that Adidas made $209M in total sales with an operating profit of $83M and a 45% margin. The average price per unit is $44, and around 593K units were sold. Looking at the sales trend, sales were highest in July ($23M) and lowest in March ($13M).

In terms of products, Men’s Street Footwear performed the best with $209M, while Women’s Athletic Footwear was the lowest with $107M. By region, the Northeast ($55M) and West ($51M) did better, while the South ($28M) had the lowest sales. For retailers, Foot Locker ($57M) and West Gear ($53M) were the top sellers, but Walmart ($15M) contributed the least.

Yearly comparison shows that 2021 performed much better with $171M compared to only $38M in 2020, which means a strong growth year-over-year.

So overall, this dashboard gives a complete picture of Adidas’ sales – where they are strong, where they are weak, and how they can focus on regions, products, and pricing to maximize profitability.
